My personal website for resume and stuff

## Deployment

I put this here because I tend to forget between the long update cycles.

My website is currently hosted with firebase, under my gmail account.
If on a new computer, you'll need to: (after installing npm)
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase list
```
To push the changes, do a `firebase deploy` 

Maybe I'll move to github hosting or something in the future.
